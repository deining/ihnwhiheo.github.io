  summary: How can we model the form of change in an outcome as time passes by? This question is of importance to researchers who examine developmental, longitudinal, or consecutive measurements across multiple occasions. What solves their problems is a statistical technique called Latent Growth Curve Modeling (LGCM). This tutorial guides readers from the concept of LGCM to interpreting results with intuitive examples.

  summary: Researchers often have questions about inter-relationships between observed variables (indicators) and latent variables (factors). The Multiple Indicators and Multiple Causes (MIMIC) model is one of the models to quench the thirst for such questions. This tutorial introduces the idea of MIMIC models and, with a simple example, explains how to fit and interpret them.

  role: Heo & van de Schoot
  timeline: "2020"
  url : https://www.rensvandeschoot.com/tutorials/wambs-checklist-in-jasp-using-jags/
  summary: This tutorial illustrates how to follow the When-to-Worry-and-How-to-Avoid-the-Misuse-of-Bayesian-Statistics (WAMBS) Checklist in JASP using JAGS. Among many analytic techniques, we focus on the regression analysis and explain the 10 points for the thorough application of Bayesian analysis. After the tutorial, we expect readers can refer to the WAMBS Checklist to sensibly apply the Bayesian statistics to answer substantive research questions.

  role: Heo & van de Schoot
  timeline: "2020"
  url: https://www.rensvandeschoot.com/tutorials/advanced-bayesian-regression-in-jasp/
  summary: This tutorial illustrates how to interpret the more advanced output and to set different prior specifications in performing Bayesian regression analyses in JASP. We explain various options in the control panel and introduce such concepts as Bayesian model averaging, posterior model probability, prior model probability, inclusion Bayes factor, and posterior exclusion probability. After the tutorial, we expect readers can deeply comprehend the Bayesian regression and perform it to answer substantive research questions.

  #url: ""
  summary: This tutorial illustrates how to perform Bayesian analyses in JASP with informative priors using JAGS. Among many analytic options, we focus on the regression analysis and explain the effects of different prior specifications on regression coefficients. We also present the Shiny App designed to help users to define the prior distributions using the example in this tutorial. After the tutorial, we expect readers can understand how to incorporate prior knowledge in conducting Bayesian regression analysis to answer substantive research questions.

  role: Heo, Veen, & van de Schoot
  timeline: "2020"
  url: "https://www.rensvandeschoot.com/tutorials/jasp-for-bayesian-analyses-with-default-priors/"
  summary: This tutorial illustrates how to perform Bayesian analyses in JASP with default priors for starters. We deal with basic procedures to do Bayesian statistics and explain ways to interpret core results. In each analytic option, a brief comparison between Bayesian and frequentist statistics is presented. After the tutorial, we expect readers can perform correlation analysis, multiple linear regression, t-test, and one-way analysis of variance, all from a Bayesian perspective, and understand the logic of Bayesian statistics.
