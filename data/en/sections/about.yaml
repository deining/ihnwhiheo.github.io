summary: 'I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Quantitative Methods, Measurement, and Statistics](https://psychology.ucmerced.edu/graduate-program/areas-focus/quantitative) at the University of California, Merced. My interests touch on Bayesian inference, structural equation modeling, longitudinal modeling, and missing data analysis. I am also interested in such topics as hypothesis testing and metascience.
